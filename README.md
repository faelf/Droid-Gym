To deploy this page to GitHub Pages from its GitHub repository, the following steps were taken:

6. Chose the main branch for deployment, and clicked on save.

## Testing

- [W3C CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input)
- [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input)
- Google Chrome Lighthouse in Developer's Tools

### Bugs
#### Testing The Deployed Page
- The links weren't working, and checking the HTML, I had misspelled the path.

#### Testing on the W3C Markup Validation
- After running the W3C Markup Validation, there was a H2 tag missing in the Gallery Section.
![W3C Validation Result Screenshot](/assets/readme/w3c_validation/w3c-html-validation.png)
Add a H2 tag with a class Hidden, and this was the result
![No errors message](/assets/readme/w3c_validation/no-errors.png)

#### Testing on the W3C CSS Validation
- There was no errors found.

#### Testing Using Lighthouse
- These were the results of the lighthouse:
![Index Accessibility](/assets/readme/b-index-accessibility.png)
![Index BP](/assets/readme/b-index-bp.png)

- On the other pages I had the same results. And these are the results after fixing the bugs.
